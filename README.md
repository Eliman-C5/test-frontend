# Junior Fullstack technical test (FRONTEND)

This is the frontend repo of my test. On this repo I did some things to show my skills:

* The user can register, confirmate his mail and login
* If user is not login, so user wonÂ´t go to homepage
* I used Bootstrap and CSS for styling
* User can get his tasks, create a task, update a task and delete a task (CRUD)
* I used Typescript and React for building the frontend
* I created many routes with React Router DOM
* Taking advatange of my knowledge in React, I componetized my code with React features like Context and Custom Hooks
* Also, I made a basic test of the login page with Cypress
